## Entity grid page
1. Table has pagination, filtering and sorting.
2. Each row has action buttons - Edit and a checkbox for multiple deleting

## Entity profile
I see this in the next way: If entities are quite simple - they are created and edited in a modal window. If the are large and supposed to have multiple tabs - let's do it as a separate page.

## Example
Probably this template almost represents the UX: https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin
